# beamforming

This repository contains the code I've developed for my final project as a mechanical engineer student. This code was written on MATLAB.

Start by reading a .wav file, on the same folder from the code. My .wav files had 4 hydrophone signals and I did not split them. The signal I measured was a pulse, you can adapt the code to your type of signal.
