# beamforming
It's a simple code I wrote for my final project as a mechanical engineer student. This code was written on MATLAB.

You can start by reading a .wav file on the same folder from the code. My .wav files had 4 hydrophone signals and I did not split them. The signal I worked on was a pulse, you can adapt the code to your type of signal.
