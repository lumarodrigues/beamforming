# beamforming
It's a simple code I wrote for my final project as a mechanical engineer student. This code was written on MATLAB.

You can start by reading a .wav file on the same folder from the code. My .wav files had 4 hydrophone signals and I did not split them. If your signal is a pulse, you have to adapt the code and create a trigger.
